# SE_DAY4_Software-Project-Management
## 1. Why is timely delivery crucial in software project management, and how can project managers ensure that deadlines are met?
Timely delvery is crucial in software project management because:
1. The project deadline is achieved or surpassed which will bring satisfactions the project stakeholders especially customers.
2. It helps prevent cost over run. When project is taking longer than expected it will lead to incurring additional cost in terms of money and other resources.
3. If project is delivered on time, the reources on the project can be released and channeled to another project.
4. It helps ensure meeting and complying with service level and other contractual agreements.
5. It gives us competitive edge, reputation and help us take advantage opportunities in the market.
6. It guide from going outside the scope of our project.

Project managers can ensure that deadlines are met by:
1. Ensuring proper planning and setting clear goals
2. Ensuring proper communication and collaboration between the project teams and stakeholders
3. Assigning and pririotizing tasks appropriately
4. By regularly tracking and monitoring progress
5. Allocating adequate resources for the project
6. By not committing to too much beyond capabilities
7. By breaking down the project into smaller manageable parts and deal with the parts one after the other
8. Ny carrying out proprt risk assessent to identify and migitake risks of time overrun
   
## 2. How does effective cost control contribute to the success of a software project? What strategies can be used to prevent budget overruns?
Effective cost control contribute to the success of a software project because it ensures that the project is completed within budget, reduce financial risk, and enhance profit maximization. Effective cost control controibute to the success of a software development in the following way:
1. By ensuring that project is delivered within budget and prevent budget overrun
2. By ensuring that funds are available for necessary resources for the project
3. By ensuring the profitability of the project
4. It ensures maximising the return of invcestment on the project
5. It aids effective decision making
6. By giving competitive advantage to the project
7. It ensures client satisfaction

The following strategies can be used to prevent budget overruns:
1. Proper planning: It is important to do a proper project planninb that define the scope and boundaries of the project. Then use the scope to breakdown the project works into different components by using work breakdown structure (WBS). The WBS will then be use to make necessary resources estimations for the project.
2. Cost estimation: Use the out of the planning above to make cost estimation for the project. The cost estimation should consider historical costs on similar projects, likely cost variation due to inflation, and where necessary, contingency can be added to the cost estimate for unexpected cost variation.
3. Cost tracking: Necessary mechanism should be put in place to track actual cost expenditure such as setting approval limits, proper record keepings, etc
4. Cost monitoring: Properly monitoring the cost by comparing the cost estimation (budget) with the actual cost incurred to identify variances, use the variance to carry out corrective measures by investigating the reason for the variances, and where necessary, review the initial budget for necessary update.
5. Efficient resources allocations: Allocate reources to task based on needs and priorities.
6. Negotiate for discounts: When dealing with vendors and or contractors, ask for discounts and bonuess but without compromise to quality
7. Outsource: Look for a cheaper external sources to get woork done. Quality should not also be compromise.
8. Cost concious awareness: Create cost concious awareness training for team members.
